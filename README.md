# Facts and Figures App Plan

## About This Project

The Tax Foundation has published Facts and Figures since 1941. In it's current incarnation, it includes statistics for all 50 states and DC across a broad array of tax topics. This data is published as a quick reference book, ideally for use by state legislators to see how their states' taxes compare. But this format alone is no longer sufficient; our data needs to be digital-first and readily accessible with smartphones. This is the plan for transitioning Facts and Figures to an application for iOS and Android.

## App Requirements

* Must support iOS and Android
* Must be easy to navigate to desired information, or to simply browse
* Must be updateable with new data

## Design and Function

Mockups illustrating design and information flow are in process.
