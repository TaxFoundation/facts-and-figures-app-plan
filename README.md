# Facts and Figures App Plan

## About This Project

The Tax Foundation has published [Facts and Figures](https://github.com/TaxFoundation/data/tree/master/facts-and-figures/2015) since 1941. In it's current incarnation, it includes statistics for all 50 states and DC across a broad array of tax topics. This data is published as a quick reference book, ideally for use by state legislators to see how their states' taxes compare. But this format alone is no longer sufficient; our data needs to be digital-first and readily accessible with smartphones. This is the Request For Proposal for transitioning Facts and Figures to an application for iOS and Android.

## App Requirements

* Must support iOS and Android (could be two native apps, or one hybrid framework app)
* Must be easy to navigate to specific information, or to simply browse
* Must be updateable with new tax data as it's available

## Work Process Requirements

* Development must take place in a private GitHub repo (or multiple repos) controlled by the Tax Foundation, to which developers will be given full access
* Full source code used during the project will be delivered to the Tax Foundation upon completion
* Full documentation of how to update the app/data will be delivered to the Tax Foundation
* Developer will submit apps to Play Store and App Store on behalf of the Tax Foundation upon our approval
* The Tax Foundation will pay for services 33% upfront, 33% upon completion, and 33% upon acceptance to the Apple App Store

## Design and Function

Mockups illustrating design and information flow are in process.
